# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### Language Model Selection Fallback Chain (2026-04-24)

**Author:** Linus (Backend Dev)  
**Status:** Accepted  

Use three-pass fallback in `pickModel()` (CopilotService):
1. `{ vendor: 'copilot', family: 'gpt-4o' }` — most preferred
2. `{ vendor: 'copilot' }` — any Copilot model
3. `{}` — any available language model (custom providers)

On total failure, show "Open Copilot Settings" action that navigates to `github.copilot` settings scope, then throw with updated message mentioning custom provider support.

**Rationale:** Extends compatibility to firewall-restricted orgs and custom LM providers while maintaining model quality preference. Error messaging is actionable for self-service debugging.

### Wizard UX Refresh (2026-04-24)

**Author:** Rusty (Frontend Dev)  
**Status:** Implemented  

Redesigned UserStoryWizard and supporting styles (8 component polish passes):
- Card: clean panel + accent top border (no gradient)
- Progress: horizontal rail with numbered circles + connectors
- Icon: Lucide SVG sparkles (emoji → vector)
- Story inputs: prefix-label compound ("As a", "I want", "So that")
- Preview: blockquote styling with accent border
- INVEST grid: enlarged + animated entrance
- Buttons: elevated primary + outlined secondary with hints
- Hints: repositioned to wizard body bottom

**Non-breaking:** All props, callbacks, state logic, scoring untouched.

**Rationale:** Professional visual identity and enhanced UX clarity while preserving all backend logic and component APIs.
